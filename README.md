3 Personalized Learning Path Generation

Overview

This Python script demonstrates a simple algorithm for generating personalized learning paths based on users' interests, past course engagements, and performance data. It includes classes for representing users and courses, as well as a learning path generator.

Requirements

Python 3.x
Installation

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Usage

Define courses and users in the main function of the script.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python learning_path_generator.py
The script will generate personalized learning paths for each user based on their interests, past course engagements, and performance data.
Example

Suppose we have users with different interests, completed courses, and performance metrics:

User 1: Interests in Python and programming, completed course "Python Programming" with a score of 90.
User 2: Interests in machine learning and Python, completed course "Machine Learning Basics" with a score of 85.
User 3: Interests in web development and Python (no completed courses or performance data).
User 4: Interests in data science and Python, completed course "Data Science Fundamentals" with a score of 88.
The script will generate personalized learning paths for each user, recommending relevant courses based on their interests and past engagements.
