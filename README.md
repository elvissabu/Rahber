3 Personalized Learning Path Generation

Overview

This Python script generates personalized learning paths based on users' interests, past course engagements, and performance data.

Project Structure

The project folder contains the following files:

learning_path_generator.py: The Python script for generating personalized learning paths.
README.md: This README file providing an overview of the project.
Requirements

Python 3.x
Usage

Ensure you have Python installed.
Define courses and users in the main function of the script.
Run the script using Python:
bash
Copy code
python learning_path_generator.py
The script will generate personalized learning paths for each user based on their interests, past course engagements, and performance data.
Example

Suppose we have users with different interests, completed courses, and performance metrics:

User 1: Interests in Python and programming, completed course "Python Programming" with a score of 90.
User 2: Interests in machine learning and Python, completed course "Machine Learning Basics" with a score of 85.
User 3: Interests in web development and Python (no completed courses or performance data).
User 4: Interests in data science and Python, completed course "Data Science Fundamentals" with a score of 88.
The script will generate personalized learning paths for each user, recommending relevant courses based on their interests and past engagements.
